        <h4>Why.</h4>
        <p>Right now you won't really get much for backing the Patreon, beyond being labeled as such in the discord. But you will be helping cover the small running costs of the community.</p>
        <p>If we get more than a handful of folks we will keep you updated on what it goes towards.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col1">
        <h4>Why not.</h4>
        <p>There is really no expectation for any member of the community and you should absoluelty not back this if you can not afford to.</p>
