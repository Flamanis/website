# Spaces vs Stories 

*Caveat: This advice will be applicable to many games at many tables but far from all.*

## Intro

My favourite thing about GM’ing is breathing life into a setting and creating a story. The operative word being creating, not telling, not acting as the auteur & reading from a script.
In the vein of “being the players’ biggest fan”, I’m here to enable them to create awesome moments. So I’ve found myself looking at preparation differently as I’ve gained more experience as a GM & started looking at sessions through the lens of my time as an interaction designer.

More often than not when game night rolls around and your players gather, they have a goal, or more to the point their characters do. It might be; explore the dungeon, rob the bank, romance the dowager countess or avoid being caught drunk at the wizard school.

Now for those of us that prep or use/create encounters & adventures it’s common to think in terms of narrative, a series of events that can be strung together in some kind of order.

**It might look something like this:**


1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
